# Octane
A voxel raycasting engine built entirely in Rust using Vulkan, with the help of GLSL. Created without direct dependency on C or C++, and with as few dependencies as possible.

The goal of this project is to build a specialized game engine for use in future projects. It also has served as a learning exercise in many ways.
